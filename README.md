# IntelliClock
Smart alarm clock that uses a web interface that smartly sets the alarm based on weather, traffic, and analytical data. Uses Raspberry Pis for extra features such as automatic coffee or smart light sensor.

Project from college. I was responsible for most raspberry Pi code and interacting with Google Maps and DarkSky API for the webpage. Also contributed to creating circuits for the breadboards attached to the Raspberry Pis.
